# Java Workshop - Object-Oriented Data Access Layer (DAO)

Welcome to the README file! 

I recently participated in a Java workshop aimed at creating an object-oriented data access
layer (Data Access Object - DAO) and developing a UserDao class to perform operations on a database.

During the workshop, I learned how to create and apply the DAO design pattern to provide a flexible and independent data
access layer. We focused on creating the UserDao class, which allows for operations such as adding, modifying, deleting,
and searching for users in a database.

Here's what I learned during the workshop:

- I became familiar with the concept of the DAO pattern and its application in practice.
- I created a UserDao interface and implemented its methods, such as adding, modifying, deleting, and searching for users.
- I learned how to connect to a database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) technology.
- I implemented unit tests for the UserDao class to check the correctness of all functions.
- We discussed various use cases for the DAO layer, as well as its advantages and disadvantages.


Thanks to the workshop, I gained the skills needed to create an object-oriented data access layer, which allows for
easier management and manipulation of data in Java-based applications. The workshop also provided a solid foundation for
further exploration of design patterns and database-related technologies.
